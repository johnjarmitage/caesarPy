# Notebooks to analyse the output of CAESAR-Lisflood runs with microplastic

The directory contains the four notebooks used to analyse the model runs for the synthetic catchment and Tet catchment related to the development of the microplastic transport model and the publication "A numerical model of microplastic transport for fluvial systems in the land-sea continuum" that is under review.

* `plastic-erosion-law.ipynb` - correlation of Shields number and dimensions.
* `plot-grainz-rectangle.ipynb` - notebook to plot the output of the synthetic catchment runs.
* `plot-hydro-fit-tet.ipynb` - notebook to plot and find the best fit model for the Tet catchment.
* `plot-grainz-tet.ipynb` - notebook to plot the output of the best fit Tet catchment model.
* `plot-SPC-tet.ipynb` - notebook to plot the microplastic flux against water flux.
